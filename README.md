# Chaos Manor Rebooted

This repo contains complete documentation of a new homelab setup.

## Objective

This home setup is meant for software development along with offering a secure environment at home for local file storage and backups, DNS lookup of hosts on the network, and other more basic features. Because some elements are meant to be local versions of decentralized cloud services in the future, there will be a heavy emphasis on use of Docker, Kubernetes and Helm for deploying software in a portable manner, so similar setups can in the future be deployed into decentralized cloud platforms like the [Akash Network](https://akash.network).

## What's in a name?

[Jerry Pournelle](https://www.jerrypournelle.com) write a blog and a column in _Byte_ magazine called "Computing at Chaos Manor" which was an early instance of writing in public about building a homelab. I am in the process of refitting our homelab, and thought this would be a fitting nod to his early work.
